        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I’m a visual artist, full stack software engineer, and NYC tour guide. I’m passionate about making human oriented experiences that are accessible to all.
        </p><p>
          As a software developer, I code in JavaScript, React, Node.js, HTML, CSS and Python — and could probably even remember BASIC from my Commodore 64 game-playing days.
        </p><p>
          For the last 20 years I’ve been working as an artist (that's my painting in my profile) and developing websites as a self-taught web developer, mainly focusing on the front end and server setup. Last year I decided to consolidate my two passions of art and web development, by taking Fullstack Academy’s web development boot camp to consolidate my skills as full stack software engineer.
        </p><p>
          I thrive on human connection – such as when I’m leading food cart tours as a NYC tour guide or speaking to a group about my artworks. On that note…
        </p><p>
          “The only rule for making art, is that there are no rules”
        </p><p>
          I love saying that at the start of all of the art workshops that I lead, where I encourage participants to spend time looking at the world around us in a different way. These workshops are based on my drawing-a-day project, where I haven’t missed a day in 10 years! It’s been shared by the Whitney Museum, Met Museum, Central Park, National Park Service, Jewish Museum and more.
        </p><p>
          I bicycle to get nearly everywhere, in every season, including to my art studio in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and have fixed more than 100 flat tires in NYC.
        </p>
        <p> Get in touch about planning a project together that’s in the intersection of coding and visual experience.</p>
